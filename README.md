# Twitter Follows

## Objectives

1. Create a complex Domain Model 
2. Implement an active follow relationship (following )
3. Implement the passive relationship (i.e. followers )  

## Instructions

In Twitter, a user follows many other users. That person can be followed by many people. For example, I follow @coffeedad and @cher. @coffeedad has many followers and so does @cher. 

Take a few minutes and discuss this with your tablemates. How you would you domain model this out? What tables/foreign keys would you need? How would you domain model this out? Once you've sketched out an ideal, check out the chapter below from the Rails tutorial to see one way you might do it.
